Builds Things

Bldr is a simple command line tool that wraps the details of your build tool(s). It helps larger organization to standardize on
a life-cycle across different build tools.
It's configured per team with a simple YAML file (.bldr.yml)

Bldr can run anything that can be run on the command line!
